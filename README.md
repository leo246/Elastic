# Elastic

Microsoft Windows documentation, based on the Linux installation/setup documentation (https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/getting-started.html)

The aim was to create and document a Elastic cluster on a Windows device, using purely native Microsoft commands (i.e Powershell).  

Still work in progress...
